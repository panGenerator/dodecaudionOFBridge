Libraries needed to run this project
- OpenFrameworks 007 http://www.openframeworks.cc/download/
- ofxUI ofxaddons.com/repos/500

Running the project - short version
1) Go into Your OpenFrameworks directory (the one which has addons, apps, libs folders).
2) Make a directory - works best if it's named `pangenerator`
3) Download the project from git and extract it to a sub-directory or clone it via git clone git@github.com:panGenerator/dodecaudionOFBridge.git  
4) Open the project in xCode and hit 'run'

Running the project - longer version
1) Perform the steps from the short version but place the project in the directory of your choosing
2) Open Project preferences -> build settings, scroll all the way down and set the OF_PATH so it points to OpenFrameworks directory (the one which has addons, apps, libs folders)
3) Manually drag the ofxOSC (`addons/ofxOsc/src` directory and `addons/ofxOsc/libs/oscpack/lib/osx/osc.a`)
4) Manually drag the ofxUI (`addons/ofxUI/src` directory)
6) In the project file browser in xCode remove all the files which point to broken locations (highlighted in red)
6) Hit run and pray that the paths are fine. If not try to read the compilers/linker's errors. It'll most probably be something wrong with the paths - You can always roll on with the "short version"
